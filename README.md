# FIFA_Player_Wage_Analysis

Soccer has been a game that is beloved around the world. According to the Big Count survey conducted by Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) in 2021, there are more than 265 million players actively involved in soccer around the world. When the last FIFA World Cup was held in 2018, FIFA grossed an annual revenue over 4.64 billion dollars. As a fan of soccer games, in this project I am interested in providing a reliable way of identifying the wage of a FIFA player. Particularly, I want to explore the following questions:

•	Does the position of the player in the team affect his weekly wage?

•	Every player has his preferred foot when playing soccer, does it affect the player’s weekly wage?

•	How does the club the player joins affect the player’s weekly wage?

•	Are there other interesting associations with weekly wage that are worth mentioning?


In the project, I would use the proportional odds and multinomial logistic regression to model the odds of a FIFA game player earning a certain degree of salary based on a range of characteristics. The goal of this project is to identify important characteristics that are associated with wages of professional FIFA players and quantify the relationships. The language used is R
